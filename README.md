This repository contains an SQL-based project focused on analyzing Netflix content data. The project demonstrates practical SQL skills, including table creation, data manipulation, and solving real-world business problems.

Features:
Table Schema:

A netflix table with fields like type, title, director, cast, country, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, and description.
Business Problems Addressed:

Count of movies and TV shows on Netflix.
Identification of the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
Listing all movies released in 2020.
Determining the top 5 countries with the most Netflix content.
Finding the longest movie available.
Identifying content added in the last 5 years.
Listing all movies directed by a specific director (e.g., Rajiv Chilaka).
Fetching TV shows with more than 5 seasons.
Count of content items in each genre.
Percentage of content released in the United States.
Filtering movies that are documentaries.
Identifying content without a listed director.
Top 10 actors with the highest appearances in Indian content.
Categorizing content as "Good" or "Bad" based on the presence of keywords like "kill" or "violence" in their descriptions.
SQL Queries:

Includes advanced SQL techniques such as:
WITH clauses and ranking.
STRING_TO_ARRAY for parsing lists.
CASE statements for content categorization.
Window functions and data aggregation.
Sample Dataset:

A sample dataset of Netflix content is included to help test and validate the queries.
Usage:
Clone the repository and load the table schema into your preferred SQL database.
Execute the SQL queries to explore insights from the Netflix dataset.
Learning Outcomes:
This project is ideal for learning and showcasing SQL skills for data analysis and solving business-related problems using databases.

Future Enhancements:
Expand the dataset with more fields or records for deeper analysis.
Integrate with visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI for better insights.
Automate the analysis pipeline with Python or other scripting languages.
